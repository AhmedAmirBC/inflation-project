# inflation-project

Scraping inflation data from the web, and storing it in a form that is useful for analysis
Data pulled from [here](https://www.inflation.eu/)

## Vision
The vision for this project is to create a utility that allows me to easily engage with inflation data for financial analysis. This includes potential functionality like importing the inflation data for various countries into one's analysis notebooks.
